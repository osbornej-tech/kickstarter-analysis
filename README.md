# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis on Kickstarter data for Louise 

[Data file used in analysis](https://github.com/osbornej-tech/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) 

## Overview:
This project aims to assist Louise in understanding the data from her kickstarter campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges:
I utilized custom formulas such as: year(), countifs(), sum() to compute the values for specificed items requested. I used references from one cell to the next to lookup up values such as the goal amount and the outcome. Additionally, I used pivot table and filtering to assist with the development of line charts and images for this project. I did not encounter any challenges or difficulties completing this task because I am familiar with using this software.


## Results: 
### Conclusion on Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Overall, the theater outcomes based on launch date was relatively successful  from one month to the next. For the month of October, there were no reports of there being a cancelled event. Generally, it appears that monthly there were twice as many success reported from January to September and November. However, during the month of December there similar number of successes and failures reported.

### Conclusion on Outcomes based on Goals
There weren't any cancellations reported for plays. Based on the goals bin utilized, there appears to be more reports of success than failures. Once the success and failure were the same times when the goal was $15,000 to $19,999. Once the campaign failed to meet its goal completed when the goal was $45,000 to $49,999. There were more reports of failures than success when the goal was $25,000 to $34,999 and greater than $50,000.

### Limitations of the Dataset
The data set reports various currencies; however, not all currencies are equivalent. It is important to have all the currencies in one exchange rate.  

### Possible tables or graphs to create
We can assess the length between start and end dates to see if outcome was correlated to the length of the campaign. Furthermore, analysis should be completed  to see if the spoltlight and the number of backers influence the outcome for that campaign. Furthermore, we can compare the success of the different subcategories. One can assess how the blurb provided impact. We can acces the count of categories and outcome by country.
